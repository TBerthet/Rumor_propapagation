# Rumor propapagation model

This project aims to use a reaction diffusion model applied to the case of rumor propagation. It"s a group project that was realized for a biomathematics course. 

# Structure of the project :

`CR_ProjetBiomaths` is a PDF explaining our project and including most of our work sum it up and explained.
`Propagation des rumeurs` is a PPTX file of the project final presentation

`Images` : folder with useful pictures for the project
`matlab` : folder of the Matlab files used
`references` : some papers that were useful to build this project
